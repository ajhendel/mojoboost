"""Device-side active-row compaction.

The GPU trainer currently finds a node's rows by scanning all `n_rows` and
filtering on a per-row leaf id (see histogram_gpu.mojo): every histogram
costs a full pass over the dataset whatever the node's size, so a tree costs
`num_leaves * n_rows * n_features` bin reads where the CPU builder's
row-index lists cost `n_rows * n_features` per level. This module holds the
replacement: one device-resident permutation of the row indices in which
every live leaf owns a *contiguous* half-open range, so a node's histogram
reads exactly its own rows and nothing else.

The layout
----------
`rows[0 : n_active)` is a permutation of the rows this tree grows on (the
bag, or every row when unbagged). Leaf `node` owns `rows[begin : end)`, its
`LeafRange`. Splitting a leaf stably partitions its own range in place: the
rows going left come first, in their original relative order, then the rows
going right, also in their original relative order. The children's ranges
are therefore `[begin, begin + n_left)` and `[begin + n_left, end)` and the
live leaves keep tiling `[0, n_active)` exactly, with no gaps and no
overlap, for the whole tree. Nothing outside the parent's range is ever read
or written by its split, so sibling leaves cannot be disturbed.

Why stability matters
---------------------
The CPU grower's `partition_rows_into` (tree.mojo) is a block-counted,
prefix-summed, stable partition, and its comment records the property this
module has to keep: both sides come out in ascending row order whatever the
block count, so the parallel result is identical to the serial one, index
for index. Compaction here reproduces that exactly, which is what lets the
two backends be compared row list against row range. Since the partition is
stable in *buffer* order rather than in row-id order, a root seeded from a
GOSS sample that is not ascending still tracks the CPU grower's list, which
is seeded from the same sample in the same order.

Determinism
-----------
The device partition is a flag pass, an exclusive prefix sum, and a scatter.
Every destination index is a pure function of the element's position and the
integer prefix sums, so no atomic decides where a row lands and no run-to-run
scheduling difference can reorder the output. The prefix sums are exact
Int32 sums over 0/1 flags, so they cannot round.

Bagging
-------
Compaction subsumes the OUT_OF_BAG sentinel: the bag is written into the
first `len(bag)` slots and the root range covers only those, so an unbagged
row is simply not in the range any kernel iterates. Nothing has to mark it,
match it, or skip it, and a bagged tree reads `len(bag)` rows per node
instead of `n_rows`.

Missing values and categoricals
-------------------------------
`RowRouting.goes_left` is the same rule as `Tree.goes_left`,
`SplitInfo.goes_left`, and the existing `_partition_kernel`: a categorical
node routes by 256-bit set membership (bin 0, the missing/unseen/dropped
bin, is never a member, so those rows go right), a numerical node sends the
feature's missing bin whichever way `default_left` says, and every other row
goes by the inclusive threshold. The host reference model and the device
kernels call the same rule with the same arguments, so they cannot drift.

Bounds safety
-------------
Ranges are validated on the host before any launch: a range must sit inside
`[0, n_active)`, `n_left` must lie in `[0, count]`, and child ids must be
new and distinct from the parent. Every kernel guards its own element index
against the range length, so the tail block of a partial threadgroup writes
nothing. Row ids are Int32 and are checked against `n_rows` when the root is
seeded, so the indirect bin loads `bins[feature * n_rows + row]` stay in the
matrix.

Allocation
----------
Every device buffer is allocated once, at construction, sized by `n_rows`
(plus one Int32 per scan block and one for the total). Splitting a leaf
allocates nothing on the device and, on the host, at most appends to the
range table. The scatter writes into a second full-size buffer and a copy
kernel folds just the parent's range back, so the ranges other leaves hold
stay valid: ping-ponging whole buffers would invalidate them.

**Ownership and growth.** `GpuActiveRows` owns exactly the index machinery:
`rows`, `scratch`, `offsets` (one Int32 per row each), the per-scan-block sums,
the one-element total, and the pinned staging buffers. Nothing here ever
reallocates: the buffers are sized for the *dataset*, and every tree, node,
and split works inside that fixed footprint, so there is no capacity growth
policy because there is no capacity that grows. What does grow is the host
`LeafRangeTable`, by at most two `LeafRange` appends per split, and it is
cleared at every `reset_root`. A dataset larger than the buffers is not a
resize, it is a different `GpuActiveRows`.

Empty leaves
------------
An empty range is a first-class state, not an error. `partition` of an empty
window enqueues nothing and reports zero rows left, and its two children are
recorded as empty ranges at the parent's own offset, so the live ranges keep
tiling `[0, n_active)`. `enqueue_range_histogram` for an empty node zeroes the
output and returns without launching an accumulation, which is the histogram
that node has. A leaf that holds no rows therefore costs one zeroing pass and
no row work, and never a special case in the caller.

Multiclass, bagging, and GOSS
-----------------------------
One `GpuActiveRows` holds one permutation, and a K-class round grows K trees
over it, one per class, in sequence: `begin_tree` reseeds the root and clears
the range table, so class `k + 1` starts from a clean permutation. The class
index does not reach this module at all, because which rows exist does not
depend on the class; it reaches the gradient plane instead, through
`LeafFrontier.plane` and `gpu_leaf_batching.ITEM_PLANE`.

Bagging and GOSS reach it in exactly one way: as the `bag` list handed to
`begin_tree`, which becomes the live prefix. There are no per-row weights on
the device and none are wanted. GOSS's amplification of the small-gradient
sample is applied to the gradients before they are uploaded (see
`goss.apply_goss_scaling`), so a row's weight is already inside `grad[r]` and
`hess[r]` by the time any kernel here reads it. A second weight vector would
be a second place to scale, and two places to scale is one too many.

What is not here
----------------
This module owns no dataset, gradients, or histogram output. Those live in
`GpuHistogramBuilder`, and the range-histogram entry points below take them
as pointers so the builder can call in without a second copy of anything.
See `handoffs/apple_a1_active_rows.md` for the step-by-step replacement of
the leaf-id filtering path and `handoffs/connect_02_gpu_dataflow.md` for the
frontier seam (`begin_tree_with`, `apply_commit`, `check_frontier`) this
module offers a grower.

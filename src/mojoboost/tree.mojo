"""Leaf-wise (best-first) tree growth.

Grows a single regression tree the way LightGBM does. At each step the leaf
with the highest split gain anywhere in the tree is split, until num_leaves
is reached or no leaf has a positive-gain split. For each split, the smaller
child's histogram is built directly and the larger child's is derived by
subtraction from the parent's.

Leaf values use the second-order Newton step with LightGBM's L1 shrinkage:
-T(G) / (H + lambda_l2), where T soft-thresholds the gradient sum by
lambda_l1 (see split.mojo).

`params.max_depth` bounds how deep a leaf may sit without disturbing that
order: growth stays leaf-wise and trees stay unbalanced, a leaf that has
reached the limit simply offers no split and so is never selected. Depth is
counted in edges from the root, so the root is depth 0 and max_depth=1
yields a stump; values <= 0 mean unlimited, as in LightGBM.

Growth also carries each frontier leaf's branch feature set, the features
split on between the root and that leaf. When feature interaction
constraints are configured, the branch set determines which features the
leaf may split on; see interaction.mojo for the rule. With no constraints
the branch sets stay empty and the allow masks stay empty, so the
unconstrained path is unchanged.

Feature subsampling (see sampling.mojo) draws one feature set per tree from
`tree_index` and the seed, and optionally a further set per node. Only the
tree's set is ever accumulated into histograms, so excluded features cost
nothing and sibling subtraction stays exact; the per-node set narrows the
split search on top of that.

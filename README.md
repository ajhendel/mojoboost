# mojoboost

Gradient boosted decision trees in [Mojo](https://www.modular.com/mojo).

mojoboost is a from-scratch GBDT library in the LightGBM family. It uses
histogram-based split finding and leaf-wise (best-first) tree growth, and it
matches LightGBM's default hyperparameters so results are directly comparable.

## Why Mojo

LightGBM and XGBoost are excellent, mature C++ libraries. The bet here is
that Mojo enables a simpler codebase that is at least as fast, because the
hot loop of gradient boosting (histogram accumulation over binned features)
is exactly what Mojo is built for. Explicit SIMD with per-chip vector widths,
compile-time specialization of the training loop for bin count and dtype
(no virtual dispatch or runtime branching), precise control of memory layout
for cache tiling, and structured parallelism, all in one language that also
targets GPUs from the same source.

## Status

Early development. Training works end to end. What works today, each piece
with tests

- quantile (equal-frequency) feature binning into `uint8` bins, LightGBM
  style, with stored edges so trained models predict on raw, unseen data
- histogram accumulation with the sibling subtraction trick
- best-split search with the standard second-order gain formula,
  `min_data_in_leaf` and hessian constraints
- leaf-wise (best-first) tree growth with `num_leaves` cap and Newton-step
  leaf values
- objectives: squared error, binary logistic, poisson, and multiclass
  softmax
- validation-set early stopping with `min_delta` for every objective,
  truncating to the best round
- evaluation metrics: RMSE, log loss, accuracy, and ROC AUC with
  sklearn-matching tie handling
- sample weights for every objective, LightGBM semantics (weighted
  gradients, hessians, and base scores; zero-weight rows are ignored)
- feature importance, split counts and total gain, matching LightGBM's
  two importance types
- SIMD histogram kernels (pointer-based scatter accumulation, vectorized
  sibling subtraction and split scans)
- model serialization: `save_model`/`load_model` with a versioned text
  format that stores floats as raw bit patterns, so loaded models predict
  bit-exactly; multiclass models via `save_multiclass_model` and
  `load_multiclass_model`
- multiclass end to end on raw data: `fit_multiclass` returns a
  `MulticlassModel` with `predict_proba` and `predict_class`

```mojo
from mojoboost import BINARY_LOGISTIC, BoosterParams, TreeParams, fit

def main() raises:
    # features is column-major: features[f * n_rows + r]
    var params = BoosterParams(100, 0.1, TreeParams.default())
    var model = fit(features, n_rows, n_features, labels,
                    BINARY_LOGISTIC, params)
    var p = model.predict(row)   # raw feature values in, probability out
```

Lower-level entry points `train`, `train_with_valid`, and
`train_multiclass` operate on pre-binned matrices.

## Roadmap

1. Multicore training (feature-parallel histogram accumulation)
2. scikit-learn style `fit`/`predict` Python API via Mojo interop
3. Broader benchmark suite (XGBoost, real datasets)
4. GPU training

## Defaults

Matched to LightGBM so comparisons are apples to apples.

| Parameter | Default |
|---|---|
| `num_leaves` | 31 |
| `learning_rate` | 0.1 |
| `n_estimators` | 100 |
| `min_data_in_leaf` | 20 |
| `max_bin` | 255 |
| `lambda_l2` | 1.0 (LightGBM's own default is 0; benchmarks set both to 1.0) |

## Development

Requires [pixi](https://pixi.sh).

```sh
pixi install
pixi run test
```

## Benchmarks

Reproducible from `bench/` (methodology, exact parameters, and caveats in
[bench/README.md](bench/README.md)). Both drivers generate bit-identical
synthetic data from the same splitmix64 stream and train with matched
parameters. 100,000 rows x 100 features, 100 rounds, Apple M4:

| | mojoboost (1 thread) | LightGBM (1 thread) |
|---|---|---|
| Regression: training | 3.53 s | 2.41 s |
| Regression: binning | 0.55 s | 0.81 s |
| Regression: train MSE | 0.003615 | 0.003797 |
| Binary: training | 3.50 s | 2.32 s |
| Binary: train logloss | 0.267034 | 0.267168 |

Within 1.5x of single-threaded LightGBM on training and faster at binning,
with no multithreading, GOSS, or EFB yet.

```sh
pixi run bench                 # mojoboost
pixi run -e bench bench-lgbm --threads 1
```

# CatBoost catalog, and an oblivious grow policy for mojotrees: design draft

Status: design draft, 2026-08-16, written by the review session from reading
CatBoost source (cited per item) and LightGBM/XGBoost source read earlier
today. Nothing here is implemented, run, or measured on mojotrees. Every
number is estimated or a derived bound unless it says measured. Items marked
"verify" were written from the CatBoost paper and docs and must be checked
against source before a lane builds them.

Sources read: `catboost/cuda/methods/greedy_subsets_searcher/greedy_search_helper.cpp`,
`.../split_properties_helper.cpp`, `catboost/private/libs/algo/greedy_tensor_search.cpp`
(all `master`, Aug 2026). Comparator for anything in this document that
changes the model: CatBoost at its defaults on the same Mac (CPU-only there),
reported beside LightGBM `stock+det`; never instead of it.

## Part A. Catalog: what CatBoost does, whether we should, and who owns it

| # | CatBoost mechanism (source) | What it is | Moves bits? | Ours to take? | Owner | Rule |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | Per-level physical row reordering (`MakeSplit`: "segmented sort; segmented gather for each stats + indices; update part offsets and sizes") | After each level's split, rows are physically sorted so every leaf's rows are contiguous; gathers coalesce | No (order-preserving version) | Yes, GPU, if the histogram kernel is gather-bound | GPU | (2) trade: a sort per split vs coalesced reads; behind a switch, A/B after the decomposition probe |
| A2 | Small-leaf-first with sibling subtraction (`if (firstLeaf.Size < secondLeaf.Size)`; `SubstractHistograms`) | Build the smaller child, derive the larger | — | Already ours, both backends | — | — |
| A3 | `random_strength` (`scoreStDev = RandomStrength * derivativesStDevFromZero * modelSizeDecrease`; `SetBestScore(randSeed + taskIdx, ...)`) | Seeded noise added to candidate scores before argmax; a regularizer LightGBM lacks | Only when > 0 | Yes, all growth modes, default 0 | CPU (`split.mojo`), GPU search kernel for parity | (3) when on; deterministic under the seed and across workers |
| A4 | Bayesian bootstrap / `bootstrap_type` (**verified from source**, see A4 note) | Row weighting instead of row dropping: every row kept, each given weight `(-log(U + 1e-100)) ** bagging_temperature`, redrawn once per tree | Only when on | Yes for CatBoost mode (their default sampler). Built in `sampling.mojo`, off by default. **Device cost, checked:** per-row weights disable the constant-hessian plane (`round_has_constant_hessian`), so the device accumulates three planes and the Int16 gradient-staging arm loses its better half (staged bytes per visit 7 -> 9 at the default group, not 9 -> 7). Not free on the device even with no device code written. | CPU (`sampling.mojo`) | (3) when on; **carries a constant-hessian exclusion**, see the note |
| A5 | Ordered target statistics for categoricals (CTRs; "verify" against `catboost/private/libs/algo/` CTR code) | For each of several random permutations, a categorical value in row i is replaced by (sum of targets of earlier rows with that category + prior) / (count + 1); plus counters and pairwise combinations; test time uses all rows | Yes (feature values change) | Yes; it is CatBoost's real accuracy edge on high-cardinality columns and independent of tree shape | CPU (`binning.mojo`, categorical, dataset) | (3); design section B2 first, then lanes |
| A6 | `leaf_estimation_iterations` (`gradient_walker.h::FastGradientWalker`; defaults in `catboost_options.cpp::GetEstimationMethodDefaults`) -- **verified from source** | Re-estimate leaf values 1..k times, derivatives recomputed at the current leaf value each pass | Only when > 1 | Built on the CPU, opt-in, default 1. **DEVICE: not cheap, structural** (GPU orchestrator, 2026-08-16): each extra iteration needs per-leaf grad/hess sums after the previous raw-score update, so a second reduction per leaf per iteration inside the tree (more launches, against the oblivious command-buffer budget) or leaf estimation moved out of the device round (more host trips). **Correction:** an earlier version of this row said CatBoost defaults to 10 for logloss AND multiclass. Logloss is 10; **multiclass is 1**. The 10 in that block is the unreachable Gradient slot while the default method is Newton, and CatBoost's own docs agree. | CPU built; device design decision before any device lane | (3) when > 1; see A6 notes |
| A7 | Ordered boosting (`BodyTailArr`, tail derivatives only) | Derivatives for row i from a model that never saw i | Yes | No for now; large machinery, matters most on small data | — | design note only |
| A8 | Symmetric (oblivious) trees (`numScoreBlocks = 1` for `SymmetricTree`; leaf index = split-condition bits; depth default 6) | One split per level for all leaves | New mode | Yes, opt-in `grow_policy=oblivious`, both backends | CPU search+schedule; GPU cross-leaf reduce + level partition | Part B. **CPU half BUILT.** Shape/numbering/aggregation **verified from source**; the per-leaf min-child rule is **NOT verified, it is ours** (see below) |

## A8, verified from source

Status: the CPU half of A8 is implemented on `lane/oblivious-cpu`
(`growth_policy.GROW_OBLIVIOUS`, `split.find_best_split_shared`,
`tree._grow_oblivious_levels`). The lane read CatBoost `master` (Aug 2026)
before building.

**Marking, and read this before quoting anything below.** The tree SHAPE, the
leaf numbering, the cross-leaf aggregation and the parameter defaults are
**verified from source** and each cites the file it came from. The per-leaf
min-child rule is **NOT verified and cannot be**, because the parameter does
not exist in CatBoost's symmetric mode; it has its own heading below and is
marked as our decision. Three further corrections to the draft follow.

Files read:

- `catboost/private/libs/algo/greedy_tensor_search.cpp`
  (`GreedyTensorSearchOblivious`, `GreedyTensorSearchDepthwise`,
  `FindBestCandidate`, `SelectBestCandidate`, `CalcScoreStDev`)

- `catboost/private/libs/algo/score_calcers.h` / `.cpp`

**Confirmed.** One split per level applied to every leaf, bounded by
`for curDepth < MaxDepth` ending in one `currentSplitTree.AddSplit(bestSplit)`;
leaf index is the bit pattern (`splitWeight = 1 << splitParams.Depth`);
`depth` defaults to 6, `l2_leaf_reg` to 3.0, `random_strength` to 1.0,
`grow_policy` to `SymmetricTree`; `numScoreBlocks = 1` for `SymmetricTree`
against `leavesToVisit.size()` for the other policies, which is the GPU
statement of "one score per candidate, not one per leaf"; the score is
accumulated with the leaf loop OUTSIDE and the candidate index inside
(`UpdateScores`: `for leaf ... CalcScoresForLeaf(... updateSplitScoreClosure)`);
the model is stored as `TreeSplits` / `TreeSizes` / `TreeStartOffsets` plus a
`[treeIndex][leafId]` leaf-value table.

### The per-leaf min-child rule is OURS. NOT verified from CatBoost source.

**There is nothing in CatBoost to verify it against, and this row must never
be read as saying otherwise.** `OBLIVIOUS.md` B2 said, marked *verify*, that
"CatBoost scores leaves that fail as zero contribution". That sentence has no
referent. CatBoost's `SymmetricTree` has no `min_data_in_leaf`: its own
documentation scopes the parameter to Depthwise and Lossguide
("This parameter is used only for Depthwise and Lossguide growing policies",
`catboost/python-package/catboost/core.py`), the CPU code reads it only in
`GreedyTensorSearchDepthwise` and `FindBestCandidate` where it gates whether
an *already existing* leaf is expanded rather than whether a candidate's
*child* is admissible, and the CUDA searcher switches even that off for
symmetric trees (`IsTerminalLeaf`:
`const bool checkLeafSize = Options.Policy != EGrowPolicy::SymmetricTree`).
CatBoost also has no `min_sum_hessian_in_leaf` / `min_child_weight` parameter
at all (`min_child_samples` is a synonym for `min_data_in_leaf` and nothing
else). So CatBoost never had to define what happens when a leaf fails these
tests, and we are choosing a behavior they had no need to define.

**The rule we chose:** a leaf that fails `min_data_in_leaf` or
`min_child_hess` at a candidate contributes zero to that candidate's summed
gain and does not veto it. **Why this one, and it is not a parity argument:**
the GPU device implements zero-contribution-without-veto, and host and device
must grow the same tree. Everything else is corroboration rather than
justification -- vetoing would let one narrow leaf of sixteen decide a whole
level, and CatBoost's nearest analogue is a zero *guard* rather than a zero
*penalty* (`CalcAverage` returns 0 for a child of zero weight, so an empty
child contributes nothing and the candidate survives). Do not cite a CatBoost
file for this rule. There is no such file.

The count of leaves that contributed zero at the chosen candidate is recorded
(`growth_policy.SharedSplitAudit`, and `MOJOTREES_OBLIVIOUS_TRACE=1` for a
line per level), because a split that was legal for one leaf of sixteen and
one that was legal for all sixteen are different objects.

### Corrections 2 to 4, which ARE from source

**Correction 2.** The summed score is not a sum of *gains*. `TL2ScoreCalcer`
sums `sumDer^2 / (sumWeight + l2)` over every child of every leaf and never
subtracts a parent term; the parent term comes off once per level as
`gain = score - scoreBeforeSplit` in `SelectBestCandidate`. Summing per-leaf
gains (what we do, and what LightGBM's formula spells) differs from that by
the sum of the per-leaf parent scores, which is constant across the
candidates of one level, so the two have the same argmax. Separately,
CatBoost's CPU **default** score function is `Cosine`, not `L2`, and Cosine is
not a sum at all: it is `Scores[i][0] / sqrt(Scores[i][1])` over two
cross-leaf accumulators. A10 already says we keep LightGBM's gain; this row
now says explicitly that doing so puts us on CatBoost's `L2` and not on its
default.

**Correction 3.** B3 said `num_leaves` "is ignored under oblivious and says
so". CatBoost does not ignore it: `catboost_options.cpp` overwrites
`MaxLeaves` with `1 << MaxDepth` when it is defaulted and raises
`"max_leaves option works only with lossguide tree growing"` when the user set
anything else. We ignore it because `TreeParams` cannot tell a defaulted
`num_leaves` from an explicit one, and we say so in `growth_policy.mojo`,
`TreeParams`, and `_check_oblivious`. Divergence, recorded.

**Correction 4.** B2's tie rule ("ascending feature then bin, as today") is
not CatBoost's default behavior. With `random_strength` at its default of 1.0,
noise is drawn TWICE, once in `SetBestScore` (best bin within a candidate) and
again in `SelectBestCandidate` (best candidate across features), so exact ties
effectively do not occur. Only at `random_strength = 0` does it degenerate to
first-in-iteration-order under a strict `>`, which is our rule. Our default is
`random_strength = 0`, so we are on the degenerate branch by default and B2's
statement is right for that branch and wrong as a description of CatBoost.

**Not implemented, deliberately.** `greedy_tensor_search.cpp` deletes a level
whose every leaf produced an empty child and stops growth
(`GetRedundantSplitIdx(GetIsLeafEmpty(...))`). That rule cannot fire under our
search: a chosen split needs a strictly positive summed gain, and a leaf with
an empty child contributes either zero (it failed a minimum) or exactly 0.0
(both minima off, and the candidate's two terms then equal the parent term),
so a level in which every leaf had an empty child sums to 0.0 and is never
chosen. Building it would be building a gate that cannot open.
| A9 | `Depthwise`, `Lossguide` (priority queue by gain, `MaxLeaves`) | Their versions of ours | — | Already ours | — | — |

Its entire difference from L2 is a function of `lambda_l2`, which mojotrees stock now sets to 0 | CPU (`split.mojo`) | (3) when set to Cosine; see the A10 note |

### A4 note: Bayesian bootstrap, verified from source

Status: **verified from CatBoost source**, `master`, 2026-08-16. Files read:

- `catboost/private/libs/algo/tensor_search_helpers.cpp` -- the draw
  (`GenerateBayessianWeight`), the per-tree fill (`GenerateRandomWeights`),
  the product with the user's weights (`CalcWeightedData`), and the dispatch
  over `bootstrap_type` (`Bootstrap`).
- `catboost/private/libs/options/bootstrap_options.h` and `.cpp` -- the option
  surface, the defaults, and `TBootstrapConfig::Validate`.
- `catboost/private/libs/options/oblivious_tree_options.cpp` -- the
  `sampling_frequency` default.
- `catboost/private/libs/algo/greedy_tensor_search.cpp` -- the `DoBootstrap`
  call sites, which is where per-tree versus per-level is decided.
- `util/random/common_ops.h` -- `GenRandReal1`'s range.

What that settled:

1. **The draw.** `GenerateBayessianWeight` is
   `powf(-FastLogf(rand.GenRandReal1() + 1e-100), baggingTemperature)`: an
   exponential(1) variate raised to the temperature. At the default
   temperature of 1.0 the weights are exactly exponential(1), mean 1.
2. **`bagging_temperature` defaults to 1.0** and `Validate` requires `>= 0`.
   **Zero is not "off"**: `GenerateRandomWeights` early-returns filling every
   weight with 1, which is the unbootstrapped model. Larger temperatures
   stretch the distribution, so the regularizer strengthens as it rises.
3. **`subsample` is refused beside it** ("bayesian bootstrap doesn't support
   'subsample' option"): every row is kept, so there is no fraction.
4. **Once per tree** under the default `sampling_frequency=PerTree`; the
   per-level schedule exists but is not the default and is not implemented
   here.
5. **The weight is a sample weight.** `CalcWeightedData` multiplies the
   derivatives by `SampleWeights` and then does `SampleWeights[i] *=
   learnWeights[i]`, so the effective per-row weight is the product of the
   draw and the user's weight, and the leaf denominators carry it.

Consequence for mojotrees, which is the part that is not a transcription:
point 5 means **a bootstrapped fit has a per-row hessian**, so it must not
declare `histogram.CONSTANT_HESSIAN`. `boosting.round_has_constant_hessian`
cannot see a bootstrap configuration -- its three inputs are the objective,
the sample weights and the GOSS parameters, and its signature is a GPU-visible
contract no CPU lane may widen -- so the exclusion is expressed on the
sampler's side as `sampling.bayesian_bootstrap_varies_hessian` with
`sampling.check_bayesian_bootstrap_hessian_declaration` as the guard a round
loop must call. Widening the predicate itself is an open cross-campaign item;
see the lane report.

Not implemented: `sampling_unit=Group` (one weight per query group, which
belongs with the ranker), `sampling_frequency=PerTreeLevel`, and the
Bernoulli/MVS/Poisson bootstrap types. `canonical_bootstrap_type` refuses
Bernoulli by name because mojotrees already has that draw as
`bagging_fraction`.

### A6 notes: `leaf_estimation_iterations`, verified from source

Read 2026-08-16 from `github.com/catboost/catboost` at `master`. Files:
`catboost/private/libs/options/catboost_options.cpp`
(`GetEstimationMethodDefaults`, `SetLeavesEstimationDefault`),
`catboost/private/libs/options/oblivious_tree_options.cpp`,
`catboost/private/libs/algo/approx_calcer/gradient_walker.h`
(`FastGradientWalker`, the loop itself),
`catboost/private/libs/algo/approx_calcer.cpp`
(`CalcLeafValuesSimple`, `CalcLeafDersSimple`, `CalcLeafDeltasSimple`),
`catboost/private/libs/algo_helpers/online_predictor.h`
(`TSum`, `ScaleL2Reg`, `CalcDeltaNewtonBody`, `CalcDeltaGradient`),
`catboost/private/libs/algo_helpers/approx_updater_helpers.cpp`
(`NormalizeLeafValues`), `catboost/private/libs/algo/train.cpp`.

**The per-objective defaults.** `GetEstimationMethodDefaults` sets
`defaultNewtonIterations` *and* `defaultGradientIterations` for every loss, and
`SetLeavesEstimationDefault` then picks whichever belongs to that loss's
default `leaf_estimation_method`. The number in the unselected slot is dead
unless the caller overrides the method.

| CatBoost loss | default method | effective default iterations |
|---|---|---|
| `RMSE`, `MultiRMSE`, `Huber`, `Cox`, `QueryRMSE`, `Lq`, `SurvivalAft`, `Focal`, `LambdaMart`, `YetiRank` | Newton | 1 |
| `Logloss`, `CrossEntropy`, `MultiLogloss`, `MultiCrossEntropy` | Newton | **10** |
| `Poisson` | Newton | **10** |
| `PairLogit` | Newton | **10** |
| `Expectile` | Newton | **5** |
| `MultiClass`, `MultiClassOneVsAll` | Newton | **1** |
| `MAE`, `MAPE`, `RMSPE`, `Quantile`, `GroupQuantile`, `MultiQuantile` | **Exact** (via `useExact`) | 1 |
| `LogCosh` | Exact | 1 |
| `Tweedie` | Newton | 1 on CPU, **20** on GPU |
| `QuerySoftMax` | Gradient | **100** |
| `StochasticFilter` | Gradient | **100** |
| `PairLogitPairwise` | CPU Gradient / GPU Newton | CPU **50**, GPU 1 |
| `QueryCrossEntropy` (GPU only) | Newton | **10** |

**The claim we were handed was half wrong.** "10 Newton steps for logloss and
multiclass by default" is right for `Logloss`/`CrossEntropy` and **wrong for
`MultiClass`**, which defaults to 1. The MultiClass block does contain a 10,
but in the `defaultGradientIterations` slot, unreachable while the default
method is Newton. CatBoost's own documentation agrees with the source
("Multiclassification mode -- One Newton iteration"); the folklore does not.
`Poisson` at 10 is the one genuinely surprising row and was not in the claim
at all.

**Mechanism.** `FastGradientWalker` calls `leafUpdaterFunc` then
`approxUpdaterFunc` per iteration; the approx is mutated in place and the next
iteration's `CalcLeafDersSimple` differentiates at the mutated point, so
derivatives are fully recomputed each pass. Leaf *weights* are not: `TSum`'s
`SetZeroDers` clears `SumDer`/`SumDer2` and deliberately leaves `SumWeights`,
which is accumulated only when `recalcLeafWeights = (iterationIdx == 0)`.

**Damping.** There is none inside the loop: no learning rate, no `1/(1+k)`.
The Newton step is `SumDer / (-SumDer2 + l2_leaf_reg * sumAllWeights /
allDocCount)` -- note the L2 is scaled by the *mean sample weight*, which
LightGBM's and ours is not. `learning_rate` is applied exactly once, by
`NormalizeLeafValues`, to the accumulated leaf value after the last iteration,
so raising the iteration count does not compound the rate.

**Line search.** `leaf_estimation_backtracking` defaults to `AnyImprovement`
and is disabled at 1 iteration
(`*haveBacktrackingObjective = leavesEstimationIterations > 1 && ...`), which
also selects the trivial walker branch. On CPU a rejected halving *consumes an
iteration*, so `leaf_estimation_iterations=10` there is between 1 and 10
accepted steps. Armijo is GPU-only. GPU has an explicit `if (Iterations == 1)`
early return.

**Exact.** `useExact` switches `MAE`/`MAPE`/`RMSPE`/`Quantile`/
`GroupQuantile`/`MultiQuantile` to `ELeavesEstimation::Exact` on a single host
without `approx_on_full_history` and without monotone constraints, pinning
both counts to 1; a `CB_ENSURE` refuses `Exact` for any other loss. Exact is a
closed-form weighted-quantile leaf refit -- it is our `_renew_leaf_values` and
LightGBM's `RenewTreeOutput`. **CatBoost reaching for a closed form on exactly
the objectives LightGBM renews is the evidence that leaf renewal and leaf
estimation are one mechanism, not two**: exact where a closed form exists,
iterative where it does not. They therefore compose by exclusion, and
mojotrees refuses the combination rather than applying both.

**What mojotrees built.** `ExtraTreeParams.leaf_estimation_iterations`,
default **1**, honored by `boosting.train`, `boosting.train_more` and
`boosting.train_with_valid` through `boosting._estimate_leaf_values`; refused
by name everywhere else. Newton only, no Gradient method, no line search, and
`lambda_l2` is *not* rescaled by mean weight -- the iteration solves our leaf
problem more exactly rather than changing which problem it is. **The
per-objective CatBoost numbers above are recorded in
`boosting.catboost_leaf_estimation_iterations` and read by nothing; our
default stays 1 for every objective, which is LightGBM stock.**

#### 1. What Cosine computes

`TCosineScoreCalcer` keeps **two** accumulators per candidate, initialized
`{0, 1e-100}` (`score_calcers.h`, `SetSplitsCount`), and its final value is

```
score[i] = Scores[i][0] / sqrt(Scores[i][1])
```

Each child of each leaf contributes through `AddLeaf`:

```
Scores[i][0] += leafApprox * leafStats.SumWeightedDelta
Scores[i][1] += leafApprox * leafApprox * leafStats.SumWeight
```

with `leafApprox = CalcAverage(SumWeightedDelta, SumWeight, scaledL2) =
SumWeightedDelta / (SumWeight + scaledL2)`, and **0 when `SumWeight <= 0`**
(`online_predictor.h`: `count > 0 ? 1./(count + reg) : 0`). `TL2ScoreCalcer`
keeps only the first accumulator and returns it directly. So Cosine's
numerator IS the L2 score, and the whole difference is the division by
`sqrt` of a second accumulator.

Written as a cosine, which is where the name comes from: with `d` the vector
of per-child steps and `g` the vector of per-child derivative sums, the
numerator is `<d, g>` and the denominator is `||d||_W`, so the score is
`<d, g> / ||d||_W` -- the projection of the proposed step onto the gradient,
which is the cosine of the angle between them up to the constant `||g||`.

#### 2. How it differs from L2, exactly, and where `lambda` lives

Translated into mojotrees terms (our leaf output is `out = -G/(H + lambda)`,
so CatBoost's `SumWeightedDelta = -G` and their `SumWeight` sits where our
`H` sits):

```
num = sum_c   -out_c * G_c        =  sum_c  G_c^2 / (H_c + lambda)
den = sum_c  out_c^2 * H_c        =  sum_c  G_c^2 * H_c / (H_c + lambda)^2
cosine = num / sqrt(den)          L2 = num
```

**Set `lambda = 0` and `num` and `den` become the same expression.** Then
`cosine = num / sqrt(num) = sqrt(num) = sqrt(L2)`, and `sqrt` is strictly
increasing on the non-negative reals, so **the two score functions have
exactly the same argmax.** This holds for any number of children, so it holds
for the depth-wise search and for the oblivious level search alike.

Equivalently, and this is the cleaner statement: for a *single* child,
`num_c / sqrt(den_c) = |G_c| / sqrt(H_c)`, in which `lambda` has cancelled
completely. **Cosine is L2 with the regularizer left in the leaf-value
estimate and taken back out of the score normalization.** That is the whole
mechanism.

#### 3. The `lambda_l2 = 0` consequence, which is the point of this row

`bench/results/LANE_RULES.md` asks whether a ratio score function has a
denominator that `lambda` was damping. It does, and the answer runs the
opposite way from the failure that shape usually produces:

- **mojotrees stock is now `lambda_l2 = 0`. At that value Cosine cannot
  change which split is chosen.** It is not a small effect at stock, it is
  the zero effect, provably and not empirically.
- The `gain > 0` admission test is unaffected too: `num > parent_num` if and
  only if `sqrt(num) > sqrt(parent_num)`, so a candidate admitted under L2 is
  admitted under Cosine and vice versa.
- Cosine is therefore reachable as a *difference* only through one of:
  `lambda_l2 > 0`; a leaf-wise (`num_leaves`-bounded) priority queue, where
  gains from **different parents** are compared and `sqrt(a) - sqrt(p)` does
  reorder against `a - p` even at `lambda_l2 = 0`; a non-zero
  `min_gain_to_split`, `feature_contri`, CEGB cost or `random_strength`,
  each of which is an absolute amount or a multiplier applied to a gain whose
  units Cosine has changed.
- The denominator's own small-value hazard is the reverse of the usual one:
  `den -> 0` forces `num -> 0` through the same `SumWeight <= 0` guard, and
  where our L2 gain blows up like `G^2/H` as `H -> 0`, Cosine blows up like
  `|G|/sqrt(H)`, which is *less* singular. The `1e-100` seed on the
  denominator is a divide-by-zero guard, not a regularizer; `min_child_hess`
  is what actually keeps `H` off the floor and it is unchanged.

#### 4. The CPU default really is Cosine, and the grow-policy story

`oblivious_tree_options.cpp:22` -- `ScoreFunction("score_function",
EScoreFunction::Cosine)`. That is the constructor default and it is not
conditioned on anything.

`oblivious_tree_options.cpp:143` -- `CB_ENSURE(TaskType == GPU ||
EqualToOneOf(ScoreFunction, Cosine, L2), "Only Cosine and L2 score functions
are supported for CPU.")`. So on CPU the enum has exactly two reachable
values, and `MakePointwiseScoreCalcer` and
`leafwise_scoring.cpp:530-551` both refuse anything else by name.

**Per grow policy, on CPU:**

| grow policy | score function used | where |
|---|---|---|
| `SymmetricTree` (default) | `score_function`, i.e. **Cosine** by default | `greedy_tensor_search.cpp:685` builds the calcer from `ObliviousTreeOptions->ScoreFunction`; `numScoreBlocks = 1`, so one num/den pair is accumulated across **every leaf of the level** and one ratio is taken per candidate |
| `Depthwise` | `score_function`, i.e. **Cosine** by default | `leafwise_scoring.cpp:530`, one num/den pair per (leaf, candidate) |
| `Lossguide` | `score_function`, i.e. **Cosine** by default | same call site |

**The claim that Lossguide defaults to `NewtonL2` is GPU-only.** The
`ScoreFunction.SetDefault(NewtonL2 / L2)` block at
`catboost_options.cpp:980-991` sits inside `if (TaskType ==
ETaskType::GPU) {` opened at line 949. On CPU that block is not reached, and
`NewtonL2` would be refused by the `CB_ENSURE` above anyway. There is no
per-policy and no per-loss score-function default on CPU.

#### 5. The parent term, which is not what a reader expects

CatBoost never subtracts a per-candidate parent score inside the calcer.
`SelectBestCandidate` (`greedy_tensor_search.cpp:955`) computes
`gain = score - scoreBeforeSplit` and then multiplies by the per-feature
weight. Under `SymmetricTree`, `scoreBeforeSplit` starts at `0.0` for the
root level and is then set to the previous level's winning **score**
(line 1214) -- which is precisely the current level's cross-leaf unsplit
score, because the current level's leaves are exactly the children the
previous split made. Under `Depthwise`/`Lossguide` it is
`CalcScoreWithoutSplit` (`leafwise_scoring.cpp:555`), which runs the same
calcer over the leaf's own totals with an empty second child.

Two consequences:

1. With no feature weights set (the default) `scoreBeforeSplit` is a constant
   across the candidates of one level, so it cancels out of the argmax
   entirely. It matters only for the `bestScore == MINIMAL_SCORE` stop, for
   `feature_weights` / `penalties_coefficient`, and for the leaf-wise queue.
2. **Under Lossguide it does NOT cancel**, because gains from different
   parents are compared against each other. That is the one place where
   Cosine changes the tree even at `lambda_l2 = 0`.

#### 6. What mojotrees built

`split.SCORE_L2` (= 0, the default) and `split.SCORE_COSINE` (= 1), as a new
trailing `score_function` parameter on `split.find_best_split` and
`split.find_best_split_shared`.

**The default path is byte-for-byte the path it was.** Nothing was deleted
from `_split_gain`, which is untouched; the Cosine arithmetic lives in three
new `@always_inline` helpers (`_cosine_out`, `_cosine_unsplit`,
`_cosine_pair`) that the default never calls, behind one `if cosine:` on a
value that is loop-invariant for the whole node. The two extra accumulator
planes the oblivious path needs are allocated with length 0 when Cosine is
off. The golden fixtures are untouched and no bit moves at the default.

Faithful to source: the two-accumulator shape, the `num += -out * G` /
`den += out^2 * H` contributions, the `H <= 0 -> out = 0` guard, the `1e-100`
denominator seed, the use of the *finished and clamped* child output as
`leafApprox` when `max_delta_step` / `path_smooth` / monotone constraints are
active (`scoring.cpp:711-720` calls `AddLeaf` with the monotonized leaf
value), and the parent term computed by the same calcer over the node's own
totals.

Deliberate divergences, each recorded here rather than smoothed over:

- **No mean-weight rescale of `lambda`.** CatBoost uses
  `scaledL2Regularizer = l2_leaf_reg * (sumAllWeights / docCount)`
  (`scoring.cpp:749`, `ScaleL2Reg`). Ours is the raw `lambda_l2`, as A6 already
  records for leaf estimation. Under Cosine this is a *bigger* divergence than
  under L2, because Cosine's entire difference from L2 is a function of
  `lambda`; a mojotrees Cosine run at `lambda_l2 = 3` is not a CatBoost
  `l2_leaf_reg = 3` run unless the mean sample weight is 1.
- **L1 composes.** CatBoost has no `lambda_l1` in the split score. Ours feeds
  the same soft-thresholded `T(G)` into Cosine that it feeds into L2, so the
  two score functions differ only in the ratio and not in the input.
- **Ordered boosting's `AddLeafOrdered` is not implemented.** It computes
  `leafApprox` from `(SumDelta, Count)` while still accumulating against
  `(SumWeightedDelta, SumWeight)`, so under ordered boosting Cosine is *not*
  `sqrt(L2)` even at `lambda = 0`. mojotrees has no ordered boosting (A7), so
  the plain kernel is the only one that applies.
- **Addend order is ours.** `UpdateScoreBinKernelPlain` accumulates the true
  (right) child before the false (left) one and seeds the denominator before
  either. We seed the denominator, then add left, then add right, and in the
  oblivious path fold leaves in ascending `hists` order. Fixed by the loops,
  not by the scheduler, so the value is identical at every
  `MOJOTREES_NUM_WORKERS`.
- **Monotone constraints.** CatBoost *projects* leaf values by isotonic
  regression and scores the projection; mojotrees clamps to the node's
  interval and *rejects* a violating candidate. That divergence predates this
  lane. Under Cosine a rejected or illegal leaf of an oblivious level
  contributes its **unsplit** `num`/`den` terms, which is the exact
  generalization of what the L2 path already does (a leaf contributing `0.0`
  to a sum of `child - parent` differences is arithmetically identical to a
  leaf contributing its parent terms to both accumulators). See below.
- **Categorical features are refused under Cosine.** A categorical
  candidate's set search (`categorical.mojo`) scores partitions with the L2
  gain internally and only its winner reaches `find_best_split`; rescoring
  that winner under Cosine would mix two score functions inside one argmax.
  Refused by name rather than half-applied, exactly as `random_strength` and
  `extra_trees` are.

**OURS, not verified, and not verifiable:** the rule that an illegal leaf of
an oblivious level contributes its unsplit terms. CatBoost's `SymmetricTree`
has no `min_data_in_leaf` and no `min_child_hess` (see the A8 note), so it
never had to define the case. The rule is chosen because it is the unique
generalization that reduces to the existing L2 behavior: under L2,
`sum over legal leaves of (child_score - parent_score)` equals
`(sum over legal of child_score + sum over illegal of parent_score) - sum over
all of parent_score`, identically. Cosine's ratio makes the second spelling
the only one that can be written, and it is the one that agrees with L2 term
for term.

**OURS, and worth a lane of its own:** with Cosine available,
`random_strength`'s noise is finally dimensionally consistent with the score
it is added to. `tree_parameters_extra.mojo` already records that mojotrees
scales the noise by a gradient RMS (CatBoost's `derivativesStDevFromZero`)
and adds it to a gain of units `gradient^2 / hessian`, which is CatBoost's
`score_function=L2` pairing and not the one CatBoost ships. Cosine's value has
units of a gradient. `score_function=cosine` plus `random_strength > 0` is the
first configuration in which mojotrees reproduces CatBoost's *actual* default
regularizer, and A3's useful range of `random_strength` is the documented one
only in that pairing.

#### 7. Supersedes

The A8 note's Correction 2 says Cosine "is NOT this and NOT implemented
here", and `split.find_best_split_shared`'s docstring said the same. Both
were true when written. Cosine is now implemented, opt-in, default off; the
rest of Correction 2 (that our per-leaf-gain sum and CatBoost's `TL2ScoreCalcer`
sum have the same argmax) is unaffected and still holds.
